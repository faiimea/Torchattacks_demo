# Adversarial sample detection based on weak dark textures

## Background

Based on the 42nd PRP scientific research program, this project realizes the function of detecting whether images are antagonistic samples according to their gray-scale texture features.

## Usage

Run `./PRP_demo/gui/ui.py` to  invoke the graphical interface. 

Click the button at the top of the interface to select the picture, and the system will automatically detect whether it is a counter sample.
